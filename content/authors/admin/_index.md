# Welcome!

I am a PhD Candidate in Economics at [CEMFI](https://www.cemfi.es). 

I﻿ am visiting Yale University in the Fall 2023. Please reach out using [sophie.nottmeyer@yale.edu](mailto:sophie.nottmeyer@yale.edu).

My main field of research is development economics. My current work focuses on technology adoption and contractual frictions in  Sub-Saharan Africa. My projects have received funding from [STEG](https://steg.cepr.org/) and [PEDL](https://pedl.cepr.org/). 

Outside of academics, I love playing lacrosse. Apart from assignments with the Spanish Women's National Team, I help run Madrid Lacrosse as vice president.
