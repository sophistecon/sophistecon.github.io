⚠Website under construction. TBC :)⚠

I am a PhD Candidate in Economics at CEMFI.

My main research interests are development, labor, organizational and spatial economics. My current work focuses on technology adoption and the role of trust, supported by STEG and PEDL.

Prior to starting my PhD, I briefly worked in international development cooperation. Beyond the lab, I play lacrosse at the (inter-) national level and help run Madrid Lacrosse Club as vice president.
